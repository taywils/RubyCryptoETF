# Proof of Concept Only

I have decided to move away from the planned Ruby version towards a different approach.
My end goal to construct a tool for crypto trading and portfolio/analysis and management did not align with the state of this project.

# RubyCryptoETF

RubyCryptoETF is a Ruby implementation of a Crypto ETF inspired by the original
Javascript version developed by [benmarten/CryptoETF].

## Status
Version 0.1.0

### Purpose

1. To provide a modular Ruby gem that will eventually be used for a either an online account based ETF or crypto asset brokerage.
2. A command-line tool to enable rapid trading and purchasing across multiple crypto asset exchanges via their public APIs
